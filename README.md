This is the Simple CRUD Application designed to manage student records efficiently. 
It allows users to perform the following operations:

Create: Add new student records.
Read: View existing student records.
Update: Modify Email of existing student records.
Delete: Remove student records of the input id.

I utilizes MongoDB to store student information, ensuring data persistence and easy management.

It is user-friendly to manage the student Records and also add validation for input fields. 
Adding Restful APIs to handle CRUD opertions.

I have use Node.js(For javascript runtime environment) and Express.js(Web framework) also Git.

Example - 
- Request -
{
    "longUrl": "https://www.example.com/some/long/url"

}

- Response -
- {
    "shortUrl": "http://localhost:3000/abc123",
    "clicks": 0
}
